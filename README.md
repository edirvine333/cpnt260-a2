## NOTES  

1. This page has been designed to be responsive, with a mobile-first approach.  
2. A grid layout was used to structure the page, and flexbox was used to provide responsiveness to the individual sections.
3. Windows is defaulting my miminum window size to 450px, therefore I am having difficulty testing my design on screen sizes smaller than this.
